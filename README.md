+ ___About Original Web Freer 1.1.1.1:___
    + In this new version of "Web Freer" there is a lot of features:
        1. ADs improvement!
        2. Installs a windows service as ADs client!
        3. Put a lot of files in our windows folder for spying or something like that!
        4. ADs.. ADs.... ADs............ :|
    + Then I removed all of em so you can use this new version of Web Freer without any Virus/Trojan/ADs.

+ ___About WebFreer Uninstaller:___
    + **Note:**
        + When you Run the original Webfreer setup, a threat service (WebClientService.exe) and some systemic threat files will install on your Windows and will remain after uninstalling webfreer!
		+ If you installed Web Freer 1.1.1.1 before on your Windows and you care about your safety/security/privacy you should uninstall it first.
		+ And then use the Uninstaller I made for removing Virus/Trojan/ADs service from windows:
            + *(Tested on Windows 7 32 & 64 bit and Windows 8.1 32 & 64 bit)*
                + **Using "Web Freer Uninstaller":**
